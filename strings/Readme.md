Reversing

Literally programmed a basic strings clone, but now it highlights anything matching wpi{*}

Solution is run it on itself.

Flag is wpi{What_do_you_mean_I_SEE_AHH_SKI}

Text description for challenge should be something like "Use this tool to help find flags!"

Give them the binary only.

Its a really easy reversing, so like baby-teir points for reversing.
